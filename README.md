# ANN Model for Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn using the `Churn_Modelling.csv` dataset. The model classifies whether a customer will leave the company (churn) based on their demographic, geographic, and account-related information.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes handling categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Feature Engineering:** Utilizes techniques like one-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., geography and gender).
- **Model Architecture:** Built using TensorFlow/Keras with multiple dense layers and dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measures model performance using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
1. Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. Divide features into independent (`X`) and dependent (`y`) variables.
3. Apply one-hot encoding to categorical variables (Geography, Gender).
4. Standardize features using `StandardScaler` for efficient gradient descent.

### 2. ANN Model Construction
1. Use Keras' `Sequential` API to define the model.
2. Create multiple dense layers with ReLU activation for hidden layers.
3. Use dropout layers to minimize overfitting.
4. Add a sigmoid activation function in the output layer for binary classification.

### 3. Model Compilation
1. Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
2. Use accuracy as the evaluation metric.

### 4. Training and Validation
1. Train the model on the training set with a validation split.
2. Use early stopping to halt training when validation loss stops improving.

### 5. Evaluation
1. Visualize training history for accuracy and loss.
2. Predict outcomes on the test set.
3. Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy score.

## Results
- Model Accuracy: Displays the training and validation accuracy over epochs.
- Model Loss: Shows the training and validation loss trends.
- Confusion Matrix: Provides insights into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
